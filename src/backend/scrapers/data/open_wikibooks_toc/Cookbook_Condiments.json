      "Exact definitions of condiments vary. Some ingredients, such as ketchup and mustard, are widely accepted as condiments while others are more contested. The general consensus is that condiments are applied at time of food service, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] especially when done to taste by the diner. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Because they are flavor enhancers, [ 5 ] [ 6 ] condiments tend to be well-seasoned with salt, acid, sugar, and/or herbs and spices. [ 3 ] [ 7 ] Some may be fermented or pickled. Many condiments take the form of a sauce or dip, and a wide variety of pre-prepared condiments are available for sale. [ 6 ]",
      "There is no universal way to store condiments. Many are shelf-stable, especially when preserved, but some must be refrigerated before and after opening.",
      "Condiments are primarily used to flavor and moisten dishes. Some foods used as condiments may also be used during the cooking process. [ 4 ]",
      "The following index contains ingredients that are commonly used or known as condiments. Because many things can theoretically be used as condiments, the list is not all-encompassing."
