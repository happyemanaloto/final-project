      "Typically, a dessert is a food that comes at the end of a meal. Its taste is usually sweet, but sometimes strong, as with many cheeses. The word comes from the Old French desservir , meaning \"to clear the table.\" Common desserts include cakes, cookies, fruits, pastries, pies, ice cream, and candies."
