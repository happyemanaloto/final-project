      "Seafood is derived from aquatic animals, such as fish, mollusks, and crustaceans. These animals provide protein in many diets around the world. The harvesting of seafood is called \"fishing. \"",
      "The term is not restricted to sea creatures, but may include fresh-water animals as well. This class of foods, perhaps unexpectedly to some, may also include land snails.",
      "The plants of the sea are often also edible, including nori , which is actually a type of algae, and is usually classified as a vegetable, rather than a seafood."
