      "Metric units are made up of a base unit and a scale modifier . Each type of measurement has its own base unit. The modifiers are shared between all units. The relevant base units for cooking are:",
      "In cooking the old unit Liter (l) is commonly used to measure volume. One liter is (exactly) equal to 0.001 cubic meters, or 1 cubic deci meter, written like: 1 l = 1 dm 3 . The prefix modifiers can be used with any unit and thus 1 cl (centiliter) is equal to 1/100 of a liter. The unit for volume is derived from the unit for length. Two lengths forms an area , which is length x length and has the derived unit square meter (m 2 ). Three lengths forms the volume metric m 3 . This has the consequence that a m 3 is equal to 1000 dm 3 , that is 10 3 = 10x10x10.",
      "Some recipes in Wikibooks Cookbook use American measurement units ( pounds and ounces, Fahrenheit, fluid ounces and pints, etc. ) and some recipes use metric units ( grammes and kilograms, Celsius, milliliter, etc. ).  An attempt to ensure that all Cookbook recipes use metric units (alone or alongside American units) is an ongoing job.  A list of recipes which have been confirmed as having metric units can be found here .",
